abstract="This paper reports the application of a previously described i.r. spectrometric method, which measures the evolution of carbon dioxide, and hence the rate of photo-oxidation, caused by UV irradiation of paint films, to a study of the dependence of paint degradation on UV wavelength. Measurements have been made on both unpigmented and TiO2-pigmented acrylic films. Preliminary measurements demonstrate that, for both pigmented and unpigmented acrylic films, the rate of carbon dioxide generation is proportional to I0.5, the square root of the UV intensity. As the rate of carbon dioxide generation is a measure of paint film degradation, this implies that the rate of film degradation is proportional to the square root of UV intensity. This is the first time that this square root dependence, previously predicted from photo-oxidation studies of model compounds, has been directly measured on a practical paint film. Photo-oxidation of unpigmented, anatase-pigmented and rutile-pigmented acrylic films has been measured by using optical filters to isolated selected portions of the output of a Xenon lamp. Results have been analyzed semi-quantitatively taking into account the measured transmission characteristics of the filters, the lamp output and the I0.5 relationship. The disproportionate deleterious effects of short wavelength, <300 nm, radiation on unpigmented films have been confirmed and the stability of anatase pigmented films to 405 nm radiation has been demonstrated directly. The FTIR assay of carbon dioxide produced by paint film degradation could be applied to other polymer films and combined with measurements of carbonyl band development.",

abstract="We used first-principles methods to generate amorphous TiO2 (a-TiO2) models and our simulations lead to chemically ordered amorphous networks. We analyzed the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the resulting structures and compared with crystalline phases. We propose that two peaks found in the Ti--Ti pair correlation correspond to edge-sharing and corner-sharing Ti--Ti pairs. Resulting coordination numbers for Ti (∼6) and O (∼3) and the corresponding angle distributions suggest that local structural features of bulk crystalline TiO2 are retained in a-TiO2. The electronic density of states and the inverse participation ratio reveal that highly localized tail states at the valence band edge are due to the displacement of O atoms from the plane containing three neighboring Ti atoms; whereas, the tail states at the conduction band edge are localized on over-coordinated Ti atoms. The                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}Upgamma{\$}{\$}                -point electronic gap of ∼2.2 eV is comparable to calculated results for bulk crystalline TiO2 despite the presence of topological disorder in the amorphous network. The calculated dielectric functions suggest that the amorphous phase of TiO2 has isotropic optical properties in contrast to those of tetragonal rutile and anatase phases. The average static dielectric constant and the fundamental absorption edge for a-TiO2 are comparable to those of the crystalline phases.",
